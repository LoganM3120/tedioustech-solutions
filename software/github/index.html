      <h1>GitHub</h1>
      <p>GitHub is the platform I use to store, track, and collaborate on code. At its core, it’s built on Git version
          control, which means every change I make is tracked, reversible, and documented. But GitHub goes far beyond just
          hosting code — it’s the backbone for collaboration and automation in modern development.
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <a href="/software/" style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:0.5rem;color:var(--link);text-decoration:none;">← Back to Software</a>
      <p>It enables collaboration, reviews, and automated deployments.</p>

      <h2>How I use GitHub in practice</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Version Control</h3>
          <p>Every change is committed with a history log, so I can track exactly what was updated, why, and when. If
              something breaks, I can roll back to a previous version.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Collaboration &amp; Reviews</h3>
          <p>GitHub makes it easy to branch off, experiment, and then merge work back in through pull requests. This
              ensures changes are reviewed and tested before going live.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Project Organization</h3>
          <p>Repositories can include not only code, but also documentation, issues, and task boards. This keeps
              projects structured and transparent.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Automation with GitHub Actions</h3>
          <p>Workflows like automated testing, linting, or deployments can run directly from GitHub whenever code is
              pushed. This helps ensure quality and speeds up delivery.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Integration with Other Tools</h3>
          <p>GitHub connects seamlessly with IDEs like PyCharm, CI/CD pipelines, and even web hosting services — allowing
              code updates to flow smoothly from development to production.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>GitHub is essentially the control center for coding projects. It ensures that my work (and my clients’ projects)
          are consistent, secure, and always ready to scale or improve over time.
      </p>
