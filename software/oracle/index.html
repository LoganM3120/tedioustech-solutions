      <h1>Oracle</h1>
      <p>Oracle is one of the most widely used relational database systems in large organizations. It’s designed for
          handling massive amounts of data securely, reliably, and at scale. In practice, Oracle databases serve as the
          backbone for storing, organizing, and retrieving critical business information.
      </p>

      <a href="/software/" style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:0.5rem;color:var(--link);text-decoration:none;">← Back to Software</a>
      <p>It provides robust SQL, security, and tools for managing critical information.</p>

      <h2>How I use Oracle in practice</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>SQL Querying</h3>
          <p>Oracle supports powerful SQL (Structured Query Language), which I use to pull, filter, and transform data.
              Whether I’m joining multiple tables, calculating metrics, or preparing datasets for analysis, SQL is the
              primary way to interact with the database.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Data Warehousing</h3>
          <p>Many companies use Oracle not just for day-to-day transactions, but also as a warehouse to consolidate data
              from different systems. This creates a central source of truth for reporting and analytics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Integration with Tools</h3>
          <p>Oracle data can be connected directly into workflows in Alteryx, visualized in Tableau, or even queried from
              Python. This makes it possible to build automated reporting pipelines that always pull from the latest
              information.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Performance &amp; Scale</h3>
          <p>Oracle is optimized for speed and reliability, even when dealing with billions of records. Features like
              indexing, partitioning, and query optimization ensure that results come back quickly even for complex
              queries.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Security &amp; Governance</h3>
          <p>Since Oracle is often the home for sensitive financial or customer data, it includes strong access controls
              and auditing tools — ensuring the right people see the right data at the right time.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>In short, Oracle acts as the engine behind enterprise data — a secure and scalable system where critical
          information lives, ready to be queried, analyzed, and turned into actionable insights.
      </p>
