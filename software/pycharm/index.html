      <h1>PyCharm</h1>
      <p>PyCharm is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) I use for writing and managing Python code. An IDE is
          more than just a text editor — it combines everything a developer needs (code writing, debugging, version control,
          and testing) into one workspace, making projects faster and more reliable.
      </p>

      <a href="/software/" style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:0.5rem;color:var(--link);text-decoration:none;">← Back to Software</a>
      <p>Features like smart completion and debugging speed up coding.</p>

      <h2>How I use PyCharm in practice</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Smart Code Editing</h3>
          <p>PyCharm highlights errors as I type, suggests completions, and formats code cleanly. This reduces bugs and
              keeps scripts readable for both myself and others.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Debugging &amp; Testing</h3>
          <p>Built-in debugging tools let me pause a program mid-run, inspect what&rsquo;s happening, and quickly fix
              issues. I can also run unit tests directly inside the IDE to confirm my code behaves as expected.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p>PyCharm organizes large projects with folders, virtual environments, and package management so everything
              stays structured — which is crucial when working with multiple scripts or dependencies.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Version Control Integration</h3>
          <p>GitHub is built right into PyCharm, so I can commit, branch, and push code without leaving the IDE. This
              keeps my workflow efficient and consistent.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card stack">
          <h3>Extensions &amp; Customization</h3>
          <p>PyCharm supports plugins and integrations (for SQL, web frameworks, and more), letting me tailor the
              environment to the specific needs of a project.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>For me, PyCharm is like a command center for Python development. It keeps all the moving parts of coding —
          writing, testing, tracking, and deploying — in one place, so I can focus more on solving problems than on
          managing tools.
